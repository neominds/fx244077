iproc_pcie_resume(struct iproc_pcie *pcie, struct list_head *res)
int iproc_pcie_suspend(struct iproc_pcie *pcie)

1.judgement was done based on the steps that been 
discribed by jayesh in PM document, it satisfies all the steps 
that the suspend is suppose to perform.
2. I have limited the pheriperals connected to
the device and performed the C-OFF commands.
only enabled USB(j346) in echi mode for the operation.

Current status:
	A) Bad mode issue during suspend-resume (top-priority)
		- Checked bad_mode after switching to 115200 - Issue not seen.
		- PCIe GBE disabled and checked for bad_mode issue - Not seen in this scenario too
		- Applied USB patches and created new kernel image - Issue still observed.
	B) USB1.1 device not detected [FIXED]
		- device wasn't detected because of OHCI disabled in kernel tree
		- When OHCI enabled in device tree, USB1.1 device is recognized, but results in bad_mode.
		- Nakayama-san Enabled OHCI and tried image with patch on GISMO.  USB1.1 works without bad mode issue. Neominds team to 
		  try the same Image offshore and check if bad mode is seen during suspend-resume.
	C) Quad SPI not working
		- Quad SPI not enabled because chip_select variable in driver structure is not set. This requires platform data
		In the driver to be filled up. More study is required to find out why platform data is missing information.
	D) SPI clock speed not set to maximum
		Not started.
Plan:
	A)
	- continue investigation/debugging bad mode issue
	Tried disableing the GBE 

	- recheck if usb patch fixes bad mode issue in suspend-resume scenario (also received Image from Nakayama-san)
	- check timers in device drivers for serial and SPI as potential candidate for bad mode issue
	- check cache invalidate/evict inconsistency or possible delay during suspend-resume
	cache management in WRLINUX9
	arm common code mangement
		1. CPU PM notifiers
		2. Local timers save/restore
		3. cpu suspend/resume
		4. L2 suspend/resume

	PM shutdown steps(https://www.slideshare.net/linaroorg/idling-ar-msinabusyworld)
		1. save per CPU peripherals 
		2. save CPU resigter
		3. clean L1 D
		4. clean state from L2
		5. Disable L1 allocation
		6. clean L1 D
		7. exit coherency
		8. call wfi 
		
	- check CPU wake-up sequence during resume for possible out of sync with cache operations
	- Try to identify task/thread causing exception during resume
	- compare resume activity sequence in kernel with baud rates 38400 and 115200
	C)
	- continue investigation/debugging issue
	- Investigate reason for platform_data not available to enable Quad-SPI mode in SPI driver
	D)
	- start working on issue
	- Find out actual clock speed at which SPI is set to operate in kernel/driver configuration
